- **Great Inventions of 20th century**

    - The `television` was developed by `Scotsman John Logie Baird` (1888-1946) in the 1920s.  In 1932 he made the first television broadcast between London and Glasgow. 
    - `Radar`  was developed by Scotsman Sir `Robert Watson-Watt` (1892-1973), who proposed that enemy aircraft could be detected by radio waves.  The first successful radar test took place in 1935. 
    - Working with radar led Sir `Bernard Lovell` (1913-2012) to make new discoveries in astronomy.  The `radio telescope` he built at Jodrell Bank  in Cheshire was for many years the biggest in the world and continues to operate today. 
    - A `Turing machine` by Alan Turing (1912-54), a British mathematician, in the 1930s.  The theory was influential in the development of computer science and the modern-day computer. 
    - The Scottish physician and researcher `John Macleod` (1876-1935) was the co-discoverer of `insulin`, used to treat diabetes. 
    - The `structure of the DNA` molecule was discovered in 1953 through work at British `universities in London and Cambridge`.  This discovery contributed to many scientific advances, particularly in medicine and fighting crime.  `Francis Crick (1916-2004)`, one of those awarded the `Nobel Prize` for this discovery, was British. 
    - The `jet engine`  was developed in Britain in the 1930s by Sir `Frank Whittle` (1907-96), a British Royal Air Force engineer officer. 
    - Sir `Christopher Cockrell` (1910-99), a British inventor, invented the `hovercraft` in the 1950s. 
    - tBritain and France  developed `Concorde`, the world’s only supersonic passenger aircraft.  It first flew in 1969 and began carrying passengers in 1976.  Concorde was retired from service in 2003. 
    - The `Harrier jump jet`, an aircraft capable of taking off vertically, was also designed and developed in the UK. 
    - In the 1960s, `James Goodfellow` (1937-) invented the cash-dispensing `ATM`  (automatic teller machine) or ‘cashpoint’.  The first of these was put into use by Barclays Bank in Enfield, north London in 1967. 
    - `IVF (in-vitro fertilisation)` therapy  for the treatment of infertility was pioneered in Britain by physiologist Sir Robert Edwards (1925-) and gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe (1913-88).  The world’s first `test-tube baby` was born in Oldham, Lancashire in 1978. 
    - `In 1996`, two British scientists, `Sir Ian Wilmot (1944-) and Keith Campbell` (1954-2012), led a team which was the first to succeed in `cloning  a mammal, Dolly the sheep`.  This has led to further research into the possible use of cloning to preserve endangered species and for medical purposes. 
    - Sir Peter Mansfield (1933-), a British scientist, is the `co-inventor of the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)  scanner`.  This enables doctors and researchers to obtain exact and non-invasive images of human internal organs and has revolutionised diagnostic medicine. 
    - The inventor of the `World Wide Web`, Sir Tim Berners-Lee (1955-), is British.  Information was successfully  transferred via the web for the first time on 25 December 1990.
